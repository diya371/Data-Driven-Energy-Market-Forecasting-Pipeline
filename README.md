# Data-Driven Energy Market Forecasting Pipeline

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the complete research, analysis, and forecasting workflow for the project **“Data-Driven Energy Market Forecasting Pipeline.”**  
The study explores the relationship between gasoline prices, energy sector performance, and market volatility using a broad set of financial and economic indicators from 2000 to 2023.

The goal of this project is to understand how changes in gasoline prices influence broader energy market behavior and to develop predictive models capable of forecasting key market dynamics.
